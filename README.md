Share2Tech 

Overview

Share2Teach is introduced as a vibrant open educational resource (OER) project crafted to
nurture a global community of learners and educators. At its core lies the principle that
knowledge should be accessible, collaborative, and freely available. Share2Teach is a
testament to the power of collective endeavour, co-crafted by students under the guidance
of their facilitators.
The project was initiated by Dr. Chantelle Bosch, a dedicated lecturer and sub-area leader for
Blended Learning to Enhance Self-Directed Learning within the Research Unit Self-Directed
Learning at the North-West University (NWU). Alongside her, Prof. Dorothy Laubscher, the
chair-holder of the UNESCO Chair on Multi-modal Learning and OER, has played a pivotal role
in shaping the vision and trajectory of Share2Teach.
Together, a platform has been cultivated where diverse educational resources are brought to
life, crafted by students for students. From comprehensive semester planning documents to
topic-specific insights, Share2Teach offers a wide array of materials tailored to enhance selfdirected
learning through cooperative learning and project-based teaching strategies.
Share2Teach serves as a beacon for educational innovation, extending an invitation to
educators and learners worldwide to contribute, explore, and evolve within this open,
inclusive community. Joining this journey means participating in the endeavour to transform
learning into a shared adventure, dismantling barriers and erecting bridges toward a more
knowledgeable and interconnected world.
